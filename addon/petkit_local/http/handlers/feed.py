"""dev_feed_get — the feeder's scheduled meals.

A feeder dispenses on its own clock, from the schedule it fetches here; the
server is not in the loop at feeding time. So the answer must always be a
well-formed schedule — an unidentified device gets an empty-but-valid one rather
than an error, which leaves it dispensing nothing instead of retrying forever.
